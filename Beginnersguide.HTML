  <h2 class="hellou">Here are some of the terms that you see almost everytime when you go to a company's financials page. All of these terms are used to measure a company's value.</h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">P/E Ratio</button>
  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
Price-Earnings ratio relates company’s shares to its earnings per share. A high P/E can tell that a company's stock is overvalued. Companies with no earnings or that are losing money do not have a P/E ratio. The ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by earnings per share.

  <div id="demos" class="collapse">
    Price to Sales ratio shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales for a stock. A lower than average ratio can show that the stock is undervalued. The P/S ratio does not imply whether the company is making any earnings. P/S is calculated by dividing the stock price by the company’s sales per share.
